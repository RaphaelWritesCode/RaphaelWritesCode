I'm a former Registered Nurse now venturing passionately into the world of IT. After years of making critical decisions in the high-pressure environment of cardiac care, I'm excited to harness that analytical prowess to solve software development challenges. As a current student of Computer Programming & Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic, I'm continually bridging the gap between my rich medical background and my emerging skills in the tech landscape.

📚 **Technical Skills**: C/C++, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, OracleSQL, UNIX/Linux, GIT, JIRA, Visual Studio, and VS Code.  
🌱 **Learning**: UML, MongoDB, node.js, and PostgresSQL.  
🔧 **Past Projects**: Spearheaded the transition of Cardiac Floor Documentation Software at Scarborough Health Network and led a C-based software project at Seneca.
